##  Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get Ducky running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or newer.
-   `pip` (Python's package installer), which is usually included with Python.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<Your-GitHub-Username>/Ducky_Project.git
    cd Ducky_Project
    ```
    *(If you don't have git, you can download the project as a ZIP file from GitHub and extract it).*

2.  **Install the required packages:**
    It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to keep dependencies clean.

    ```powershell
    # Create and activate a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    
    # Install dependencies from requirements.txt
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How to Run
