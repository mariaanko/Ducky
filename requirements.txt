Here are the contents for the `Ducky_Project/requirements.txt` file. It lists the three external Python libraries your application depends on.

```
PySide6
pyserial
psutil
```

### Why These Are Needed:

*   **`PySide6`**: This is the core framework for your entire graphical user interface (GUI). It provides all the Qt widgets like `QMainWindow`, `QPushButton`, `QTextEdit`, etc.
*   **`pyserial`**: This library is specifically for serial port communication. It's what allows Ducky to connect to COM ports and interact with network hardware.
*   **`psutil`** (Python System and Process Utilities): This library is used in the "Network Monitor" tool to get system information like CPU usage, memory usage, and detailed network I/O statistics.

When a new user clones your repository, they can simply run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and it will automatically install these exact three packages, ensuring the application runs without any "Module Not Found" errors.
